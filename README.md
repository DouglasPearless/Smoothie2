# Smoothie2
(Attempt at) A Smoothie firmware port to the Smoothieboard v2 boards.

The current plan, is only to code as much as is needed to test the various peripherals on the v2-pro board.

However, a minimal implementation of the Kernel/Module system is in the works.
Once the testing features are added, IÂ plan to try to port minimal Smoothie features.
